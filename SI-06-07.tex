Since the elastic potential energy in ELM is a measure of the total length of links, local minima in the potential correspond to cases where links are following paths in which total link lengths is not minimized. 
Rather, the configuration is optimal relative to small fluctuations in the paths. 
Finding the global minimum in such systems is generally an NP hard problem (SI1).


To do so, we perturb the paths of the links by adding thermal noise, which enables them to occasionally pass through other links and potentially find a shorter path between their end-nodes.
If the noise level is sufficient to allow tunneling through energetically costly configurations, it will result in a much more desirable layout.
We use an exponential cooling schedule to reduce the thermal noise and allow the system to converge to an equilibrium state. (SI2)
